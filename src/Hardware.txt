The AVR version of the MRB-CSCN is a software-only project.  It relies on
other hardware pieces to make it work.  Specifically, it expects:

- an Awesome Stick as a core (MRB-IAS)
- an MRB-XIO to do the signal, switch, and turnout I/O
- a BD-4X tied into XIO ports A0-A3


Pin assignment for the XIO:

A0 - West Points Upper Signal Red
A1 - West Points Upper Signal Yellow
A2 - West Points Upper Signal Green
A3 - West Points Lower Signal Red
A4 - West Points Lower Signal Yellow
A5 - West Points Lower Signal Green
A6 - West Main Signal Red
A7 - West Main Signal Yellow

B0 - West Main Signal Green
B1 - West Siding Signal Red
B2 - West Siding Signal Yellow
B3 - West Siding Signal Green
B4 - East Points Upper Signal Red
B5 - East Points Upper Signal Yellow
B6 - East Points Upper Signal Green
B7 - East Points Lower Signal Red

C0 - East Points Lower Signal Yellow
C1 - East Points Lower Signal Green
C2 - East Main Signal Red
C3 - East Main Signal Yellow
C4 - East Main Signal Green
C5 - East Siding Signal Red
C6 - East Siding Signal Yellow
C7 - East Siding Signal Green

D0 - East Turnout Timelock LED
D1 - West Turnout Timelock LED
D2 - n/c
D3 - n/c
D4 - East Turnout Control (low = Normal)
D5 - West Turnout Control (low = Normal)
D6 - East Turnout Position (low = Normal)
D7 - West Turnout Position (low = Normal)

E0 - East Turnout Request (+5=Normal, GND=Rev)
E1 - West Turnout Request (+5=Normal, GND=Rev)
E2 - East Turnout Unlock (+5=Normal, GND=Unlock)
E3 - West Turnout Unlock (+5=Normal, GND=Unlock)
E4 - (via BD4X) West OS occupancy
E5 - (via BD4X) East OS occupancy
E6 - (via BD4X) Siding occupancy
E7 - (via BD4X) Mainline occupancy
