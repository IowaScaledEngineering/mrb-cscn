The AVR version of the MRB-CSCN is a software-only project.  It relies on
other hardware pieces to make it work.  Specifically, it expects:

- an Awesome Stick as a core (MRB-IAS)
- an MRB-XIO to do the signal, switch, and turnout I/O
- a BD-4X tied into XIO ports A0-A3


Pin assignment for the XIO:
A7 - East Turnout Request Reverse
A6 - East Turnout Request Normal
A5 - East Turnout Position (low = Normal)
A4 - East Turnout Control (low = Normal)
A3 - (via BD4X) Mainline occupancy
A2 - (via BD4X) Siding occupancy
A1 - (via BD4X) East OS occupancy
A0 - (via BD4X) West OS occupancy

B7 - West Turnout Request Reverse
B6 - West Turnout Request Normal
B5 - West Turnout Position (low = Normal)
B4 - West Turnout Control (low = Normal)
B3 - East Main Signal Red
B2 - East Siding Signal Red
B1 - East Siding Signal Yellow
B0 - East Siding Signal Green

C7 - East Points Upper Signal Red
C6 - East Points Upper Signal Yellow
C5 - East Points Upper Signal Green
C4 - East Points Lower Signal Red
C3 - East Points Lower Signal Yellow
C2 - East Points Lower Signal Green
C1 - East Main Signal Yellow
C0 - East Main Signal Green

D7 - East Points Upper Signal Red
D6 - East Points Upper Signal Yellow
D5 - East Points Upper Signal Green
D4 - East Points Lower Signal Red
D3 - East Points Lower Signal Yellow
D2 - East Points Lower Signal Green
D1 - East Main Signal Yellow
D0 - East Main Signal Green
